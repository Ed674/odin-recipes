      <p>Cupcakes are all the rage. Here is a simple recipe that I love to use. You can get as creative as you feel with the decoration by adding colors to the Buttercream and piping it creatively, adding sprinkles, or topping them with coconut, these are great fun to make!</p>
      
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     
     <ul>
       <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
